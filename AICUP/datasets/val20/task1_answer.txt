10101	But like whenever we hang out, it’s just this constant stream of like, “I can’t write; I’m so blogged; I have all these projects; they’re all behind deadline; I feel so terrible; my house is a shithole. But no, don’t help me clean it, because I’m too embarrassed to let anyone help me clean it. But I’m just going to tell you about how miserable I am that it’s a shithole.” While we’re sitting in the middle
10166	I think that’s part of it. I think those are all like important things and I am glad to have said them and thought about them. I think they are important. But none of them; none of those or any of the other things, many things that I’ve said on this topic actually get to like how did it come to be the case that I asked that question?
10203	And the sort of ... there’s a significant　downside of... like I am acquainted or passingly familiar or friends with a ton of people there,　so there’s, like if I’m sitting there talking to someone, there’s always a string of people that are　like “Hey, how are you, blah blah blah” and it was just like “Hello, but I’d really like you to go　away right now”. Or just, like, it was hard to just sort of hang out and talk to a few people　quietly. Other than like, my hotel room.
10334	So then I was in this position of do I sit there and blunder about what's going on or I could tell him; and that seemed clearly less bad. But there's a sense in which it's not so much that he could handle it better, but it wasn't as painful for him, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. I think what I'm doing is just quibbling a little bit about your suggestion or I'm suggesting a way in which they might be able to handle it better.
10479	"Oh, we're going to sleep at my place tonight," then it's like, "Oh, I'm too sick to go over," and then I'm like, "Okay, fine. We stay at your place another night and, you know..." It's a lot harder to motivate myself to go over to my place and dye yarn then to already by at my place and then dye yarn because it's a whole like fifteen minute drive to my place and then I have to drive back. I guess it's not that long of a drive but like it's still... It doesn't sound like a very long commute.
10557	Like I don't really think that you would argue that you know using chemical weapons in Syria was a good thing or an okay thing. Oh, I don't want to get rid of the category, not okay. I certainly hope I didn't mean to imply that at all. No, I didn't really take you to be but that was what I was asking you if you left not ideal unbounded.
10644	He immediately came and asked me if he'd done a good job. Like, ‘I don't know.' The two of you. We may said some things without meaning to, like, ‘I want you to be taken care of when you're old and not be a burden.' Kind of like, ‘I don't want your problems,' some sort of to things and he tried to fix it but ended up asking her if she wanted us to take
1074	like my pinkie. We would have Jaime snacks, but I wasn't allowed to eat them.Jaime? Jaime, sorry, his name is Jaime, like James. Oh, James snacks? Yeah, like Jaime snacks. He would have Cool Ranch Doritos. I remember the Doritos and I wasn't allowed to eat the Doritos as much as he was. Because he was thinner?
10858	Right now you've got you way of expressing how badly you feel. Give it a shot. Don't wait until it's really bad. Just practice asking for the hugs even if it doesn't get that bad, so that we can train him to give that kind of support that you actually really want and let's see how that goes. Then I think we meet next week at the same time. Do we have the rest of July scheduled?
1089	Right. You’re not going to the pub, you’re not socializing like you used to? No, no And you’re avoiding things like exercise and things like sex, and that’s having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship. It is a bit, yeah. Ok, ok. And, looking at you. I know you’ve had an ECG. Yeah, yeah What have you been told about the results of that?
10930	I think that a lot has happened recently and more historically in your life that sort of, in reality, adds to the impression that anybody who thinks they have reasons doesn't know what they're talking about. Like it may not be. I'm just going to throw it out there though anyway and we'll think about it. So there may be times when your feelings are so intent and you come on, in your kind of subtle way, so strongly with them that you
11018	Usually I'm pretty comfortable being mad and critical at the sermons. I have been kind of the skeptic in the pew for a long time, but on this topic I'm anxious about it. I would really like this to mean something, but I just don't think it does. What do you mean by its meaning something? In other words, I guess one of the things that occurs to me is one sort of meaning, which is often the way we talk about it, is more like how does it work?
11057	Yeah, that was I was intending to give reasons not to have that conversation in the moment when I'm angry, and she has like in that moment. You're first qualifying statement was not commenting on the time scale. These are reasons to have that conversation and that sounds right. And so I guess now we're at the point of needing to talk about the time scale because I think
11140	How did they do it? How do they ignore all the crap and do what they want to do? I'm always looking for that. But I also end up looking at, "Oh, they have this thing that I never had." That cannot I cannot do anything about that so... I mean, we all compare ourselves to each other all the time, right? Or that's like some people like me who are insecure do that all do it more often. I mean... That's true.
11204	Which means I think that that either he maybe was right. I mean because I too also wonder if you I don’t entirely – well, I wonder about the extent to which you feel like you’ve done something terribly wrong, or you deserve sort of maybe like really angry or punishing, because you will allow yourself to really be taken care of. And to kind of like
11343	Okay, so basically all the stuff I end of fighting against. Okay. Yeah. And so cognitive behavioral therapy is what most people recommend for anxiety because it works for lots of people to manage the symptoms and you struggle against it but I keep sneaking it in there and I hope that at some point it will take hold for you and that you'll be able to get use out of it. But they're hard for you. Yeah.
11433	Ahh stuff that changes this mysterious brain chemistry. There's no way to measure. Things that you hear about on drug commercials and on TV and they talk about serotonin levels and norepinephrine, there aren't really ways we have to go in and measure what levels are or what the right levels are. It's an idea, but there aren't really these specifics.
11563	Even in my own university, I was with him. And he and I were traveling together. So yea, I mean, in a place like India, it's a bit risky for a single woman to go about on her own. I mean, they do it all the time. But it's just like I haven't been there in a long time. So it for me, it's a bit scary. So it's nice that he was there with me. Yea, but how can I feel secure if I have if I'm a sidekick. Well, it's funny. Isn't it funny? It's ironic because he's there to make me feel secure. But then I feel insecure because I'm not the hero myself. I'm not Batman.
11630	On a very basic level you can't control for all the factors that will upset her. And I appreciate your saying, well, me speaking is upsetting her. So I can choose not to speak, which is different than other things which seem more out of your control. But I think as a general approach in your marriage it's untenable, on so many levels, not the least of which is, the pent-up anger will just continue to grow. Right. Right. Yeah, I hear you, and I think you're right. I just don't...
11723	the least it's been, I'm taking steroids and doing all these things and so I phoned you on Friday evening because a friend of mine when I was explaining what was going on and just sort of giving him the low down he proceeded to tell me that I was too young, he says I'm way too young to have a herniated disc. He's a medical doctor?
11886	I think trading off who gets their way might be a compromise. You get your way this time; I get my way next time or not eating together.
12006	Yeah. Not for a long time. I didn't drink in high school. I definitely wasn't one of the popular kids who got invited to the parties, and so there was a couple times that my friends' parents would go away and we would get some beer, you know, and hang out at her house. Compared to what the other kids were doing, I was a really good kid in high school. I smoked pot for the first time when my younger brother gave it to me, the night before I went to college. He was hanging out with the cool kids in my grade, but when I got to college I started drinking a lot.
1209	And what we need to do is keep working until it's different enough. Yeah. That it's more recognizable. Yeah. But, yeah. I guess the other question is also like, 'did I ever do the whole like signing the waiver for you to talk to Dr. about the medicines. Um hmm? Okay. I thought I did. I was just double - I believe that's in your file. checking. Okay. I assume I signed it on her end too.
12145	number one wasn't even accurate and number two is in the scheme of everything that's going on it's almost, you can look at the ridiculousness of the way that he was speaking to me that he was...Oh because he did say at one point
1225	it's unfortunate he couldn't step out to help you, but..." She felt like it went back to his...he and Ivan are more friends than anything which is...I don't know how I feel about that but I mean he was not at all able to be...it wasn't like an initial hysteria and then he calmed down, like had a plan. No... So he was hysterical on the phone? He wasn't like sobbing and...but he was really emotional and he was very clear that he wanted me to call
12385	That is not it. That is not it. That is not it. Yeah, it is very clear. Is it clear it is what you add to that? Very clear. All right. So what is the next step? So then the next steps so hold on it is the activating, it is the event, then it is the recognizing those beliefs, and...
12450	out to Oregon, just aimless and disassociated. I can imagine that, hopefully, on a smaller scale and, hopefully, caught that's kind of what we're here to do and help you with but I can imagine that being a piece of what's happening right now. You have enough
12543	I think in her case she feels like she ought to do something but isn't quite clear what it is. And that has set up some sort of guilt cycle that prevents her from speaking to me except when she's really drunk. It's not... So I guess, in thinking about the whole thing, if this were a weekend where they were all coming... because no one's life is in a particularly wonderful place right now, and everyone was like, let's just leave everything behind and have a really good time and focus on these people who are getting married, I can get behind that in some sense.
12600	it takes longer to process individual things. So I think... those two things happening at the same time... play into it and maybe makes sense in this context where... one way of describing why I’m here is that I can’t process all of what’s happening or happened, so...
12698	that are mixed are going to be a problem, but maybe if I spend a day dying a bunch of yarn and using up all the mixed dyes then I can make that more packable. That sounds like a reasonable thing to think about and maybe setting aside time to do that dying. It is reasonable up until the point that maybe those colors might not all go together and then if I have to mix up other colors, usually I end up with more empty containers than I started with. I guess if I was really purposeful and don't care if I make really ugly color combinations, I could do it. You probably care about that, though.
12786	Yeah, so when asking questions and thinking about it, I had a desire to tell you that I feel sorry for dismissing that experience and also to tell you that I was sorry for your loss if that were the case.
12874	You'd have to look it up. They usually post that information somewhere on the website so you can check that out. Get a sense. I'm not saying count your calories because I would prefer that you be going by whether you feel full and do you feel like you're getting a good variety. Sometimes it is informative to get a sense of how many calories is a donut? How many calories is a coffee drink? Sometimes you might be way off base from what you're guessing.
12965	and that you're going to not want me to come back, and that you're going to be finished with this because you thought I was being irresponsible that I wasn't here as I should be more responsible, because I because I arranged to do the session with you. Mm-hmm. So, first of all, were you aware that all of those assumptions are selfcreated, by you, because...
13044	c) in e-mail at least there's a record of what is said; d) dad has a hard time understanding me because I don't know he says my English isn't clear enough for him, that I talk too fast and use too many big words, even though I make every effort when I'm talking to him to speak slowly and clearly. I don't find you particularly difficult to understand.
13089	In that same situation Tanya would not say anything until it was like until she was already overwhelmed by whatever negative feelings there were. That’s not helpful to anyone. Not that it’s not accepted to be overwhelmed by feelings but that like… It seems like you’re really important observation is interesting. So I think that’s a large part of what I mean about like intense moments of danger,
13144	no regard for there is a past or if there well, regard for the past, definitely, but no regard for the future. But I think my thinking is opening in that direction a little bit. And I actually do feel like or a sense that oh, I guess I'm sad right now and it feels awful. But maybe I won't feel so awful in a few hours or in a few days. I don't know. That's quite a change. Is it?
13221	I don’t think so; I think really more of what something is there like he was conveying a lot of like sort of theories about it, and I feel like I mean, one of the problems that I run into with James, is that like I’ll tell him about something that
13310	To me it seems like you don’t need as much help bearing those things or maybe any – by contrast. I guess I can also see in a way how you are feeling like being well, if I’m thinking about how to tell people about this, it’s because I want to spread it out into the world or put these bad things out there into the world. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. More something like you’re looking for some help with how bad you feel.
1336	I think without a little, a drink or something to make this go smooth, I’m like, I need some form of social lubrication here, and being around a lot of really drunk people while sober is boring. I can imagine that exacerbating a bunch of things that already bothered you. Yeah. I mean being with them in the elevators was bad enough. I guess part of what I - What I’m wondering about is, in the medication, I mean... I’m, like,
1346	I pull up the index and sure enough, the guy who had the property died with a will, and all I need to confirm is this one person was the sole heir of the will or the person in the will to get the property. But it's in storage, the file is in storage. They're starting to put everything in storage now which fucks me because these are — typically the late 60s and 70s are when I need probates and those older ones, they order on Fridays.
13586	And at the office, if I don't put things in the spot that they're supposed to be, I can't find them. So I used to get pissed off at Jess because she would lose her keys and I would always be like "Well, I never lose my keys. I never lose my wallet. I know exactly where they are. I come home and put them in the same exact spot every time," you know.
13755	and I'm kind of wondering if we really should because this week he hasn't been walking around staring at this heart looking depressed, but I'm not sure why actually. But he gets into a period of doing that. Well, meditation certainly wouldn't hurt. You know when we do the breathing exercises and the mindfulness that's a type of meditation, the same
13810	it's just that pediatricians do 900 different things, you know, 50 of which are mental health. I guess that's why I am I'm saying. Well, I imagine it's not a regular pediatrician who is in there for cold and flu and swallowing magnets. Right. I don't know who referred. It might have been her own therapist or whatever. Yeah, you know —
13985	Well, I wonder... were you going to say something? I'm very curious about what you wonder. I was just going to say it's also... I mean, I can't really even talk about it with her because she doesn't remember it. So it's like, how can I hold her accountable for something she...? I'm in a position of power in a sense, of I can say, this happened, or, you were this way. And how can she rebut or comment? So it's like I can't even, I don't know, address it or something.
14031	Right. So then you have to sort of wonder if I weren't there what would happen. Something would happen. I presume these organizations would not fall apart entirely. If I hadn't been here, what would have happened? I think Tanya's family would have come up and handled that or she would have killed herself. But then we're getting into if I weren't here this whole situation would be radically different anyway.
14091	And you don't think that way." It's like, well, I wish I could be just a little bit like that. Will I always be insecure? Or will I be able to feel a little secure in myself? You're not sure. Huh? You're not sure. No. Right now, I'm not. Because you're feeling especially insecure?
14229	You know I actually think that you being pregnant is a good thing. I’m very happy for you and hopeful that things will be good for you and. It sounds like it’s given us an opportunity to talk about these things. So thank you for that particular way of phrasing it. But I don’t think so. I actually…thank you for indulging me talking about these things while you’re pregnant. Indulging sounds so trivial, for a lack of a better term. I’m not doing it to indulge you.
14436	Yeah. So you sound like you're at your whit's end Ramona. If your saying you can't not let some of these things go for a month, do you know what I mean? That this is that important? For example, what if you were to separate? I don't mean divorce, I don't mean we're in a separation I just mean living...you went and lived with your sister for a month or something like that or he went and got his own apartment for a month?
14557	Right. That's the adaptive part for you. The down side is that your feeling those things could draw you closer to him. I know. I understand. That's why I'm here. I guess. Well, maybe I say that because that should be a question. Maybe you're afraid those feelings will actually push you away. At least the anger part. What do you mean?
14616	...Is the depression. OK. So what I've reminded you is, when you recognize an unhealthy emotion, the mantra or the question to ask yourself is, "What am I telling myself to create this?" Got you.
14689	And I don't feel good about that. I feel like that makes me this horrible, snobby, demanding, critical - Hm. Because I guess when, I feel like when you marry someone it shouldn't be, "I'm marrying you because I know you are a lawyer or a doctor." Or, you know, like, "And you will always earn a good living and have a, you know, fulfilling career that will last you until retirement, that you feel satisfied with, that earns good money, that is secure, that you're passionate about. Mm hm.
14751	Well, and you see that perfectionism in Tanya, although it typically manifests more in relation to herself. I mean, she feels it most acutely, and then most dramatically when she feels she’s falling short of being perfect. But the issue of perfectionism is definitely like,
14842	Taking her, the leaving. It was sad. Yeah, it was just a terrible day and then at night Josh had a talk with his mom and it was a really painful conversation to listen to. I'm not sure He didn't even talk to me about it. He was like, ‘I'm going to go talk to her right now.' Do you know what he which things he addressed with her?
14915	So he ended up taking more like four AM or whatever instead of two AM or something and like it was at least a two hour time difference if not longer. I think it was even one AM that he could have taken it but like, you know, he's acknowledged that he's like, you know he's told me before that he wouldn't do it again and he does it again. It's just like so frustrating. I'm like, "Why do you keep on doing this?" Because he's like, you know, being so immature. Like he doesn't want to face the day or whatever. He wants some alone time right now at like really late
14965	can't take anything, so I'm just not because I'm focused on that right now. I'm focused on just like trying to get through having really bad cramps and not being able to take any pain killers for it, that maybe I'm not so I'm like... It's weird, but it's kind of nice to be having a health situation that I'm familiar with.
15032	Like Lucille when she starts soccer she'll be much better than when Ian started soccer because she's already been kicking around a ball. Lucille's another year-and-a-half; it'll be twoand-a-half years before she can play. Instead of being cranky sitting in her little stroller, at some point she'll become more wanting to play and run around.
15115	Is there something, a change within your life, or a trigger that occurred that you recall before the symptoms began? Are you having any distressing memories that keep coming back or maybe a situation where you feel scared or really want to avoid? Well I have just moved back to town this last year with me two young daughters. I am living in my grandparents’ house - they have both passed.
15228	that feels better. And here am I going to hurt you? Are you going to hurt me? As you've gotten close to people you've gotten hurt one way or another in your early life. You know that comedienne, Margaret Cho? Do you know what I'm talking about? She has a think on salon.com
15304	making a ton of money and working all the time, so you never saw him. Yeah. Like, in other words, like your father. Yep. I would certainly imagine that you would have a problem with that too. That's the weird thing because I hated never seeing my Dad. I got to the point where I didn't want to see my Dad because I was so angry at him that I was never going to come first. Yeah.
15433	after like years of working towards it. But she feels like a failure, because she hasn’t published enough papers, and she had to step down from like some leadership position in her department. And she’s going through another divorce, and her kid is severely autistic. Because her kids’ therapist had been embezzling the insurance for like six years, the government decided that all of his therapist patients
15498	been getting either one of those. It's not that he's the opposite of your Dad and always there for you, always catering to you. Buying you flowers, figuring out what you need, you know, putting you front and center. And he's not that successful here. So it feels like both realms - Yeah. It does. you're missing out. And I think that's what has been really disappointing.
15599	Getting specific timeframes where you work on things. And just be thinking of this as this is part of what you're doing in the backdrop. I don't know if it feels like you have to get another job in the meantime. If you knew, for example, right now it's going to take eight months until you find a job. Yeah.
15653	And then they get to take that where they want. They can say, "Sorry to hear you've been looking for a while. I don't know of anything," or they can say, "Oh, I don't know. But my friend is friends with whoever. I'll drop her an e-mail." That's not a lot of effort for that person to make. Okay. Or, "Oh, I saw in my Twitter feed that such and such is hiring." Yeah. You know, they may not have to do much more than that.
1578	Yeah, we dealt with this in several different conversations also in the sense that like this is definitely related to the of something in the sense that Yes. We're all going to die. What does ideal even mean in that context? Or bounded in the vastness of time and space and what sense does a small concept of ideal how does that fit there?
15955	My goodness. She did, she said "Get the fuck away, you’re bonkers." - Did she? Anyway...Ok. ...so she did that and er, so I said yeah, I didn’t think she was clever enough really. - You know not.. and well I went to see the doctor about it. Ok. - Cos I thought I’d show her cos she’s a doctor, you know she’s been to University, she’s done stuff...  -
16043	Yeah. Even like the isn’t as much a thing anymore. Like I don’t – I ended up hurting myself. Yeah, I don’t know, I – I haven’t been thinking about hating myself as much. And sometimes it’s blank. It’s still there somewhere, but I don’t have to deal with it all the time. I –
16094	Well, I guess part of my detachment is if I remove myself from it, I can be happier. You know, I can go out with my friends. I can do things. You know. Maybe, you know, it just sort of came to me. Does the detachment itself cause you distress? Yes. It's the detachment and the sex thing and the more I put an effort in to trying, you know,
16174	Kind of been thinking about, you know, yeah if I really do have ADD, how much different my life would have been if this had been discovered, you know, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, you know. Six weeks ago. Yeah. So that was kind of bothering me a bit. Are you upset with me for not wondering about it?
16278	I just started I don't know what happened, I just came around and I didn't get a B since, you know? But it took me a year, yeah. My mom jokes around that she sent one kid off to Yale, where I went to school, and got another one back, because I changed so much throughout the four years that I was there. So at the time that you started doing better, is that when you started drinking? That's when I stopped drinking. I see.
16344	That seems like an interesting topic for all on its own in terms of if it’s that important to me, why don’t I find it sustaining or something like that? experience is something that’s confining and is limiting your options. That’s a very different thing than something that you’ve proactively committed to and that you feel fulfilled you feel good about fulfilling.
16397	But he's in class for something and he's overwhelmed. just get a creepy vibe off him. Yeah, he's just a weird dude. Just a weird dude, you know. But I wouldn't take the chance. Yeah. Ian and I in May are going to spend the night on a battleship. Oh, that's cool. You sleep in the bunks and eat in the mess hall. Neat. They do tours around the battleship and all kinds of activities.
16667	You want to separate yourself in some ways so that you can be independent of what's limiting him right now. It does sound like a lot of your worries are coming from not being able to control him, but feeling controlled by his depression. Yeah, that sounds about right. I think it's important that you're not controlled by his depression. I need time in the day to go to Hamden and make my room inhabitable again.
16860	I am afraid that I will get some bad germs that will get into my body and if I don’t lock the door, then someone will come and attack me and my family. If I don’t check the doors and windows and lock everything three times, I just feel that something bad will happen. Then I am afraid that I forgot to lock the doors and windows, so I am repeatedly checking on them. Then I must wash my hands three times because of the germs.
16973	in a way that it would be less likely in other social situations for that to happen. Um... you know, I think it,
17023	And then you end up intensifying your own thought because you end up saying what you were already saying again. You're reinforcing it because you're fighting against him. I wonder if censoring yourself a little bit to get yourself the response that you want because when you tell him that you feel like killing yourself or you feel like hurting yourself, he's going to say, "It's not that bad. Don't do it," which doesn't make you feel better.
17249	My friend, the non-doctor shared this. So I allowed myself to get into a state of hysteria because for whatever reason, we don't have to get into that I guess but I felt very desperate... I think it would be good for you to identify what contributed to your feeling hysterical. Well I think I tend to listen to people that I think are very smart and I look at them...
17332	It’s terrible. My husband is so understanding, but worried and wants me to get help because it is disruptive in our household. The kids wonder why I must do everything three times and why I can’t touch certain things in the house because of the fear of germs. I don’t want them to learn these things from me. I work as an accountant, so I have my own office and don’t have to interact a lot with the public.
17500	Yes. I would like to get your help because I feel like I can’t live my life. I am not wanting to be around groups of people. I feel irritable and have been having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I don’t have an appetite and feel nauseated a lot lately. I am 28 years old and feel like an old lady. Can you tell me when these symptoms started?
17603	oh, it burns. Marie tried it and said don't do it, like oh my God, you already did them, there's something not right with that. I don't know what it is but that like, I'm not doing any more. Yeah, I mean, it
17740	Do you think if you can step back and be a little objective in considering that that what you held was somewhat of an unrealistic expectation? Yes. Disappointing, but yes. The good news is you're probably going to live a little bit longer, oh at least 90 years -that was a joke
17862	So, like, the particularly bad period of our lives, she has essentially no memories from. What were you wondering? It's interesting because it was sort of related to that. There's one piece of dealing with Tanya's illness in the present and then also in the past, which is sort of a traumatic event, for lack of a better term, that you went through, that you feel completely alone in and you can't share with her because she was there and not there at the same time.
17964	I don't know what's going to happen the rest of today. I really hate this. And I hope. I mean at some point I have to listen to the rest of my messages. I hope I'll be able to do that soon, but I don't know. I know it's not that much to deal with, but it feels like too much. My Dad's coming tomorrow. We'll see how that goes. Mm hm.
18032	You said, you know. I don't know. I was thinking about something else. Cameron, I don't think you have enough self-confidence in yourself when it comes to lots of things. We already knew that. How does that explain why I have a ton of laundry that I needed to do two weeks ago? I think you feel kind of crummy about yourself as a result
18098	Last night, I had an hour long conversation with my friend Vanessa, who just gotten tenure last week
18145	Well, I don't know. Just like in general, depression lies to the self so I mean it's like I know there are times when I know I'm not right, I mean like when I'm feeling like, 'oh, I would be better off if I were dead,' so I mean there's the rational part of my back in the back of my mind that's like, 'no that's not true.' That's just the depression lying to you. Does anxiety lie in the same way? I guess. Sort of. How might it?
1821	All right, all right. It is. It is really interesting. It is really interesting I am just I think the connections are slow going on up here, but I think it is... It is not. See what you just did? You were demanding you should get it in a flash. Well, no, because I thought that I was under the impression that, when we spoke,
18320	And you know yourself well. I trust that, ultimately, you want to be safe and you take the steps to do that.
18354	Somewhat mitigated. Let's take a different one. Say I was to talk to my mother about Tanya's relationship with this professor. I don't know how my mother would respond, but it could go that my mother gets angry or hurt and then I have to deal with those also; and that hasn't helped me at all. So you said "mitigated," not alleviated.
18397	Yeah, I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point. Well, when one feels really, really angry at the person or people they love, being worried about the impact of that anger, I think, is a general fear. I mean, I think that's kind of a fear in general that you might have regardless of Tanya's psychologic state... Sure. And then it's exacerbated by it. So what do people do?
1848	I mean, in reality, I guess I'm not doing everything. Sometimes he does things but I think, I still think it's pretty unbalanced. It feels a bit lopsided. Yeah. It's not like I take down and write every time I've cooked or he's cooked dinner for me or stuff. So... I could be wrong about this but I don't think I am. That's... Certainly it's the story that I've been hearing in here for quite a while. Yeah.
18542	If I said, "We should start a family tomorrow." He would probably That might be a little extreme, but the point is I feel like he's been wishy washy. One random job to the next. Mm. And just, you know, going with whatever is given to him. Just not proactive, not engaged, not motivated or ambitious. Mm hm. What does he What does he really want?: Mm.
18606	liked to party or whatever, and they did cocaine, so I thought this would be fun, if we all get together and I'll get us a gram of coke to split and we can go out in Chicago and have a good time.
18714	I noticed you were wearing dressier clothes than usual. Yes. That was on purpose. So, like maybe they'll be able to start me with something as soon as Monday. If they could that would probably solve the problem at least while I'm at work and then I guess I'll have to deal with the panic in the evenings, but - If you even panicked.
18791	It’s all related because I do have all of those things. But the actual how it came to be is… Some time ago I asked you whether this would be your first child and you said it would be your first biological child. So a couple of weeks ago, then, I sort of…and I phrased that question very carefully to avoid asking the question that I then later asked to like…I did that because. Anyway.
18968	So the one I disputed... And let me point out to you teandency you have. And you know we're on the same page The journey of Jessa having a better life. Yes. When I point out things to you, it is to help you to be more aware. Of course, yeah.
19	Any overture of something that's kind of like a little white flag or peace offering to just get a week of peace, I'm not talking about permanent "I'm going to placate and cow tow to you and to talk my needs in other..." No. Just talking about lets...
19088	I don’t know. I don’t know. I guess there’s just been a lot of stress and I’m worried. I don’t know. Because I know one his really good friends— I think his name is Harris. I usually always contact him when I’m worried about Stephen, but he was out of town. Yeah. I don’t know. His roommate is—I don’t know. Never get the phone. his phone is always off. So, whenever I try to contact him, I’m always—I don’t know. It’s only been ten years later. I don’t know.
19179	But I mean the, the hard part, the letting them know you've been looking is probably the harder part to craft than the, "Hello so and so." So I have faith in you. You can do scary things if you can get through panic attacks, which we know you can, you can do this too. Okay. I will see you next week at the regular time. Okay. Still nothing from the insurance?
19263	Ok. So, you know, I started to try and avoid situations where I might get like that, basically. Right, so what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?
19389	And I wonder if having, you know, setting up some time to go to a place to go to separate from him that you're not reliant upon him being up at a certain time for you to go... Yeah. ...if that might, if that might actually feel good. It might. And then I'll get out of the house and like at least be doing something. Yeah. You get out of the house. You see someone. Yeah. Not that I'm necessarily that productive, but that's okay. But you get up and out.
19525	was really getting upset and I feel like it's now starting to effect, I don't know what I should say here but I feel like it's...not 'should' but, I feel like it's affecting my relationship as well and
19570	, then the converse is also naïve. Nothing’s perfect, so anything is okay is... equally ridiculous, really. Well, that’s sort of a permission, a blanket permission, then that’s a problem. That’s, yeah, and it often feels that way to me. It’s like, “Well, you know, we can’t make it perfect, so we might as well just not try to do anything at all.”
19718	However, when one comes up with very clear "shoulds"... You kind of see... ...And you're not in a feeling of depression for days and months, and weeks... Right. ...It is fairly safe to assume that it is not the biochemical, but your "shoulds" that are creating or largely creating it. True. That makes sense, yeah. You know? It is it
19808	The people who live in R.I. can apply for all the jobs in New Haven and Wallingford and stuff; but people who live in New Haven and Wallingford can't apply for R.I.. They'd be instantly rejected unless their cover letter had something that had they could move to R.I. for the job. I wonder if having a PO box in R.I. would be . . . except that it would be a PO box and they'd know that, so I don't think I have any friends who live in R.I. proper who I could pretend to be living with.
19865	...And disputing and disputation disputing and disputing, so that you create healthy emotions. Can you see? Oh, it is amazing. Uh-huh. Can I ask you, though I wanted to ask you this last week, actually do you feel, in being so experienced in REBT, that you need that the person I don't even want to say "should," but
19937	Yeah. I feel like you're either hoping that they can handle the same circumstance better or that for them the circumstance is less acute somehow. The only person I've talked to about Tanya's relationship is my best friend and that's because Tanya almost told him or told him most of it, but not enough, so he called me and said "what's going on?"
20055	Well, they don’t have it and they like their life and they don’t know, in some instances they can’t know what they’re missing and, also, people who have that extra sense can’t know what they’re missing by having it. I follow. Like the people in the conversation yesterday on Facebook are sort of making these comments and judgments very much within their own world view without necessarily realizing how much they are in their own world view. There is kind of another side.
20108	Yeah, I mean he knows that I'm actually not going to hurt myself, oh, what's the difference, like when he gets really crazy like he's done things like hitting his head on the floor or something. He drags himself from like trying to bash his head in on the wall, but still I'm not like Are you sure that he knows that you're not going to do it? Are you sure you know that you're not going to do it?
20165	It is not not why, beating myself up, but just that it is so interesting I find it very interesting that this can happen, that this can even become... So answer your question "Why do I think like this? Why have I become like this?" The answer is... ...Because I have allowed myself to become that way. And perhaps you didn't know you had a choice.
20187	They're just like help you cut it and then they're just like, "All right, the way in is," you know, whatever. So there's no, "OK, here's what you need to do now" or anything like that, you know. I don't think it's kind of a scatterbrain. You really do the thing where you feel There's not a clinical term for it? There's some clinical terms.
2031	Yeah. Do you know what I mean? No. Yes, it sounds accurate, actually, to what I'm feeling. And one of the biggest things that I, it doesn't feel fair to criticize, but in finding that our expectations, my expectations which he said were totally on board. Like he was on board with them. Uh huh. They were correct. Ah. He led me to believe this was all how it was going to be. Yep. He even can acknowledge that. Right.
2037	One was ridiculously long and the forms were all mixed up and not labeled with the name of the form. I finally found the form that said Customs Declaration. I spent time filling it out while people behind me skipped me in line to go ahead while I was writing. I finally get to the table and the guy is like, "This is the wrong form." I was like, "Okay. What form do I need?" "Go back and get the Customs form." It says "Customs Form".
2048	"Don't you want to play?" She went, "Mama, mama, mama, mama." So I just sat down and waited it out. Luckily Jess was only ten minutes. It's hard being the daddy. Yeah. She doesn't see me often enough. How often do you see her? I haven't seen her since Saturday. Once or twice a week? Yeah, and not always for long periods of time. Sometimes she won't interact with me if she's cranky.
20554	I do, we’re going to need to stop James, but I do, I do agree that this sort of, this sensitivity you have, you know, this sort of acute sensitivity, is something to talk about and think about together, that there is a lot there. But, we do need to stop for today. So I’ll see you next week! All right, thank you.
20595	I don't know. Maybe. Maybe in degrees he could. I don't know if it would work out. Sometimes when he gets that depressed he keeps on saying that he thinks he can't do X, Y, Z things that I think he can do, but I'm not him. I don't know if it's a cop out or if it's . . . He thinks his depression makes it so he can't physically do whatever thing and I think his depression is telling him he can't do that thing, but he could get around it.
20644	Was that what you were doing when you were overweight as a kid, were you binge eating? Mm-hmm, but not in front of people. I would do it when I was by myself. Like at night?
20720	I can't turn to my husband and say "I'm having a really rough time with your mood swings." I can't do that, I can't say "It really hurts me that you don't support me going to school." I can't do that. I can't... What if in a couple sessions you said "I'm terrified. I am absolutely terrified."
20861	what the answer to the question is. And I think well it is vaguely related. It is, in a lot of ways, related to my friend Franco, if something is too uncomfortable for him, he will just lie to my face. I’m kind of okay with it, and I’m kind of really not okay with it.
20946	I made one when I was a kid but I remember nothing about making it other than I won the silliest car, funniest car. I made, like, a Dotson, you know. I don't even remember why it was funny. Ian wants to win the silliest car but we're not making a silly car. I don't know. OK, I think you could do a fine job if you spent, you know, 20 or 30 minutes on Google and YouTube. When am I going to do that? Maybe took a trip to, like...
21027	but I couldn't stop also not being angry about her misrepresenting our conversations and the conversations she has had with a lot of good people who had advised her in one way or another that there are career things to consider also when one is getting an education.
21125	Anyway, when I like involve myself, or fend for myself, there’s at least a presumption that things could be different. But I don’t feel like that’s a possibility.
21246	You would think that I was going somewhere but . . . I know this is how Amanda works, so that also makes it hard. She has much more polarity than I do, in some ways. So I feel like sometimes I talk to her from time to time and it will be like she just has this completely different idea of what her life looks like in one conversation than a week later.
21310	Yeah. But it's like, I don't know. Like sometimes I have more control than others, but like, you know like I don't control whether or not I have rehearsal. That's like based on the semester and stuff and whether or not we have a concert coming up so you know I had a tech week last week but this week I only had rehearsal on Tuesday night because -
21405	I'm not at all questioning how you feel. You know, do you feel overwhelmed, do you feel anxious and do you feel helpless. I absolutely believe that you do. I know you're not making that up and I know it's really unpleasant. Absolutely. I'm not sure. Is this, like, a bid for attention? Do you want somebody to run in and help you out and fix it and make it better and tell you what to do? Is it because, you know, if you found instructions then you'd actually feel responsible
21456	Yeah. I think it’s even more particular than that. That the point of keeping people out, or away from what’s going on, especially like bad things you feel, I think has been because you anticipated that like that would give them a kind of – that would give other people a kind of access to you that would be very dangerous.
21554	and you're not making it up and it's okay to get upset about that or you found a suicide note today, oh my gosh let me listen or let me come over and just hang out with you." I don't know something, but quite frankly I have you and I have my sister and I'm even reluctant...I told her about the note and stuff which I didn't want to do but I really needed to have somebody... Of course you did.
21640	Okay...here it is: "What am I telling myself to make myself depressed?" When you said just now "I'm a fallible human," you jumped already to the E the effective new philosophy. Let's figure out again what you're telling yourself to make yourself depressed, and I'm not overlooking the fact that your physical pain and the steroids and whatever is going on chemically is having some effect. Yes.
21723	Sorry, I assume that was your lunch. Oh, that’s all right, don’t worry. No, I don’t really“Hey – hey, it’s Tanya. Hey are you there? James? Yeah, okay, sorry. I’m still at therapy. Chad wants me to go to ER, so can you come over? Okay, thanks. Thanks.” Do you know how long he’ll be? Probably ten minutes.
21921	A little. I'm not sure if any of the people at the library and the museum know an institution center closer to me that might be looking. I feel like if they did then that would be a good way to go because everybody in the museum thinks that my work is really good. One of the great things about doing this work was to work in the field and make contacts and start developing relationships with people that actually know your work.
21963	So what about choosing the stairs on the way up too? Is that something you feel like you could do? I guess it depends on what I have on. When I had on…the day that I had my backpack and my computer, like I guess I could of. I just was afraid I was going to hurt my back like carrying it up the stairs. I don’t carry that much on me I could. What floor is your apartment?
22069	Jess just needs to get her stupid clients to call the right number, you know. I tell her about it but I'm sure she forgets that she's got it, you know. Hopefully the person that they have an appointment with is good at diagnosing this stuff or is able — Well, there's a six month wait to see this person, so they're clearly a specialist, you know. Right. Alright, whatever.
22216	Yes. So you're doing your job. Yeah. And the temp agency hasn't come through with anything yet? No. I'm going to call... I mean, they sent they said like skipped a week of Christmas and New Years. Right. Mm hmm. So I'm going to call, I don't know, maybe tomorrow or something but they've not come through with anything yet. I will follow up and put it on your list that one of your jobs is to follow up with them tomorrow. Yeah.
22402	How is that? It's okay. I got the AC in the room so now it's livable again. It's a little bit annoying in terms of having food that I actually like to eat around and we still haven't made a trip to Hamden; but if we go out to eat for meals and stuff then that's not such a big deal. My room is chaotic, but it's not as chaotic as before, so it's like I can sleep in it without it being an issue.
22510	“I just want him to come home.” And I’m like,“Well, that’s not an option. I don’t think that’s good for him” I don’t know. I don’t know what it is. This lack of look into things, do things, I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know, but it’s. Well, maddening in two respects. One, in which . . . . . . it would be good from practical point of view, because she just dealt with this, rather than being so passive. But in other ways, I think it’s . . . imagine her passivity and floppiness and maybe even paralysis really pushes a button for you.
22607	What, in terms of like…I mean there’s…I sort of understand like. I have some awareness of why you’d be thinking about this; about Tanya in particular. But it seems like there’s a lot more to it than just what you said in terms of how you think about having a family or not having a family. So she’s working as a nanny for three small children right now,
22682	we were going to a party, and one of my friends had some. I was really nervous, like I was like is it going to hurt, what's going to happen? It was that girl that I was like, infatuated with, she was doing it, and so I was like okay, I'll try it. And I remember nothing happened, I didn't feel anything, and I was like that's stupid, like I don't feel it. Because I had smoked pot throughout the year and liked it.
22833	But, again, why would you not be waiting for that right now? And why also, for example, would it not freeze you up from leading a regular, humdrum life?
22913	about children and why she's ambivalent and she's pretty sure she doesn't want them. There's one really good part towards the end where she's like, "In the end, I think what it is, is that I don't want to love anything that much," and that's something that I know is in me. I don't want to. I was like, "Wow, that's such a simple way to say it." I know exactly what she's talking about. There is something perversely freeing in not going therecompletely.
23019	little bit it had passed a little bit, so I think I had decided that I was going to try to just like I felt really sick and I wanted to go throw up somewhere. So, we went to the building where the Red Cross thing was being held and it's a federal building, so we had to go through security. I had this gram of cocaine in my purse, that I just stuck on the security belt. Nothing happened, but I
23083	I just think it’s a little depressing that what I feel is so urgent for me to put out in the world is all the worst stuff that happens that is inside of me. The good things seem less important to spread around and – I don’t know – I don’t really think I’m comfortable with that idea. I guess I also feel like everyone would understand what it feels like to be doing pretty well and enjoying my job.
23237	The things that you have control over are exercise, which we know releases endorphins, and thoughts, which might not cause the feelings of depression, but they can exacerbate it or help to alleviate it somewhat. It's not saying that what you're thinking is necessarily the start of the symptoms, but it's something that you do have control over that can push it in one direction or the other.
2344	I'm not sure how much better I do feel, but certainly better enough to be out of the hospital. That's a good thing. Good. Yeah, that's a really good thing. Is your mind just kind of blank? Yeah, kind of. Has it been that way? I mean is that an accumulating thing? Is it being here? Is it...? It could be. I doubt it is, but I don't...yeah.
23590	I should have called you to let you know, and that not let me just say the thought first and not doing that makes me irresponsible. "As I shouldn't be." As I see, you always add that last part, and that is the... Which I'm encouraging you to do. OK, OK. I meant it before
2367	Yeah, well, assuming not rush hour. But it's enough to stop me from just doing it. I mean, that also could be the... I mean, I have gone to my place for a few hours and dyed yarn. So... I don't know. I could apply for jobs when I'm at his place and dye yarn when I'm at my place or something. But as of yet, I haven't gotten a good system to motivate myself other than the, you know, I will apply to one job a week system which...
23762	How did things work out? I've got your message obviously after... Mm hm. No you were very helpful. Thank you for taking time to call me. Sure. So Ivan said he was fine that night, that he didn't need to go anywhere and that...so he didn't do anything further. He did say "I was hoping you wouldn't find that," so we did make the distinction that he was saving it actively. Yeah
23893	"I'm educated," I said "How do you know all this about herniated discs?" and he said "Well I'm educated," and I'm like "Oh so I'm not?" like I don't know anything. So it was funny because thinking back when you made a couple comments about like is he the only, the doctor he was going to recommend, like is he the only doctor who can possibly help me? It
23948	Not days like in the last several months, but that's because there has been a sense in which the Tanya I would have those conversations with, hasn't existed in the last several months. There is a sense in which she really is there again. So, yeah, those are conversations that would be good to have as conversations and not just me telling her that she needs to take this medication.
24016	Right and you sort of, you want him to take responsibility for the, for the things that he's doing that result in you feeling angry. Yeah and it just really bothers me. He says, "I'm sorry." I'm like, "Okay, you said that the last time too." You know? And it's not... I'm not yelling. I'm not raising my voice. Like I was... But the tone feels yelling because the tone feels... Yeah. ...like you're reprimanding him. Which I am... Mm hmm.
24081	So in feeling like with the more trust you can share more, is it partly how I will talk to you about it or feeling more trusting how we'll handle it together? That would be a reasonable feeling. I'm not sure I have any reason that's anywhere as reasonable as that. I don't know as I have an articulated reason for it, which is interesting.
24244	to sleep in on another day and I don't need him for anything then I get, then I'm not mad about it and I can let it go. But when it impacts plans that we would be doing together and then I have to work around him because he stayed up all night. It's just really tiresome. Yeah. I'm sorry that you guys are having such a hard time being happy together
24304	And it's taking care of me in a way. Or even if I do the cooking, but she still comes over and talks with me about my day. And she still follows up, like, "How did your interview go?" Mm. And she's always still taking care of me and she's always been very reluctant to share if even a small thing in her day went wrong. Oh. She's very much the Mom.
24366	What do you want him to do? What do you want his response to be? I don't know. Because I feel like if he did give me permission to kill myself that would probably make him a very bad boyfriend. And it sounds like you don't actually want to. At least not now, but when I feel like that
24444	It's a little bit more nebulous in your 20s, but it's still pretty common, certainly with a lot of different people under stressful circumstances. Yeah. My friend, Franco our friend, Franco my best friend, is here in Andover. He went with me a lot. I let him take care of me a fair amount. It's easier because he's here. I don't know. The hurdle of traveling was large. But then, why are we here? We're here because . . .
24552	That's true skepticism that there isn't necessarily one right but that there are lots of ways to look at something or lots of possibilities and we're uncertain, that there's some level of uncertainty in any of the beliefs and sometimes that you're not necessarily choosing a different belief, but your just choosing to believe that there may be some wiggle room or some error in any one belief gives people freedom to just feel more comfortable.
2465	the feeling it gave me. But I knew I couldn't do it, and so I didn't snort any in Geneva. I just tried to put a little bit on my gum, but panic just set in. Mm-hmm. Now, I can't even like I used to smoke pot sometimes with my friends, which kind of helped me calm down, and I can't even I can't do that anymore, it makes me panic immediately.
24770	at the same time. I started getting my weight under control. I mean granted, I started doing drugs and was on my way to potentially having an eating disorder. I started losing weight, and even with all my GI problems, I made dean's list first semester, sophomore year.
24850	Well, you probably don't remember this because it was sort of in the throes of the stuff, but we had talked about how not being able to remember things can feel like not having control over things in the way you feel you should. I don't remember talking about that. Yeah. And so it can be something you blame yourself a lot for, I think. Yeah. Yeah.
2494	But if setting that up for yourself, if setting up a certain number of applications and you get to go on the trip stops you from applying stops you from applying because you don't think you deserve the trip then that's not... Okay. ...that's not helping you either. True. We need to find something that gets you to do something to help yourself. Mm hmm. So far all I can really do is just guilt myself and hope...
25010	And you were worried you might start to feel like doing something? If I took the Adderall, yeah. You know, like I'd go to the office and do something, you know, which I probably should have done. I'm going straight to the office from here. And I had motivated and made that decision before I took the Adderall. But I definitely can tell the difference. Not too long after taking it, like right now, from how I felt, you know, an hour ago. Good, I'm glad it's helping. It could be really
25069	I was telling my mom everything would be okay, but in my mind I was like, "Well, what are the chances of him coming to our house?" They could have. Yeah, but then I was like, "What are the chances that any of this is happening? It is happening in my backyard in all of our backyards in that neighborhood so for any one
2515	It does go away, but I feel like I have no control over it. It’s happening. If it happens more and more, and like if the Seroquel isn’t going to help either then like, I mean I guess I it’s helping some, but it’s not helping enough. And like I can’t, you know, I don’t know if the Imipramine has stopped working or something and I can’t really go back on Wellbutrin because it’s really bad for anxiety. And I’m just like…I’ve run out of options.
25256	and then it would come in today after 8:00 p.m. I'm like well, I'm not going to take it until Monday anyway, so what's an extra day? So I haven't started it yet. Gotcha. So I'll probably start tomorrow. So how did the diagnostic process go? It was a series of questions, a lot of questions. Yeah. Of, you know, mild, moderate or severe or none at all, you know. Right.
25309	words. Yeah, “lost” is the word that... comes to mind, more than ruined. But yet, there is a sense of... yeah, I guess there is a sense of ruined to it, just isn’t the... You know, I understand why you ask the question before,
25377	get the prescription refilled, there is no practical value in asking, 'why did you do this?' Because she's already fixed it in some sense or as much as it is possible to fix it at that point. And so there's no immediacy to the discussion even to happen and at that time she already feels guilty
25516	things like the highest likelihood of success, combined with what it’s most likely I’d actually do. Yeah; logistics are hard, but not that hard. They’re hard if I want them to be hard. This tutoring session’s going to be more; I thought about just taking the car somewhere. I think maybe I just won’t go to tutoring. When’s it at? 2:30.
25557	now I can move on, you know? Mm-hmm. But I just didn't it was carried over from high school. I was never a great academic student in high school. I was average, maybe a little bit below, but I just didn't try, I didn't really care, and I don't know why that is. My mom asks me a lot now, like what was your deal?
25685	I think James should come and you guys should go to the ER, and I think it’s possible by the time they see you, you’re feeling better enough, or you think you’re feeling a little better; if you’re waiting there three or four hours, and you start to feel better, call me, and you can come back here and we can talk. Okay. You know this evening, either of them, you can come by. And, we can go from there; I’m happy to do that. But, there’s something about that
25785	Not very often anymore. Does she have future plans for herself? So she's talking about wanting to be a priest. And so she's a little bit excited about that and a little bit terrified about that. And those are... I understand both of those, and that's fine. I feel like wanting to be a priest is mostly a response to feeling like she can't be academician and feeling that's the closest thing.
25837	I might ask first. That’s like a crappy metaphor for what I think was going on. I actually want to know, but that’s like…I also recognize that that’s a level of knowledge about you that I have no reason to expect you would want me to have and I’m actually really okay with that. But it’s this idea that like I have unintentionally stepped on you that led me to ask the actual question.
25874	Then I…Friday morning I have my actual appointment with Dr. Barnes. They’re going down to Rhode Island and I actually need to help cook because my mom has an  What’s going on with your mom? Did I tell you that like my parents have been fostering cats with kittens?
26021	That's the so I guess the equivalent of if nobody's going to use chemical weapons then what can you do within those options? People feel trapped when they feel that none of their options are okay. Then you're trapped. So the question is how can we make the options available to you okay? And then in that you actually probably could see more good in each of them than is apparent right now. You know, I'd like to know more about what you're thinking but I'm going to need to wait two weeks to
26092	Maybe that’s true somewhere, but I don’t think that’s the point at the end of the day. I think the point at the end of the day is that Tanya can’t take care of herself or can’t always take care of herself. I’ve certainly become frustrated talking about it. I’m not sure if I articulated why I’m frustrated but… Well let me make a running analogy which may not be helpful to you so,
26197	So are there ways that you can sneak in maybe a little bit more activity into the day? It sounds like you've made some healthy changes with regard to what you're eating and the other way to burn calories is to find activity that you can sneak into your day. Even though it's really hot,
26286	That will help a little bit, I think. Last time I did move it actually did only take me a day to pack. I had a lot less stuff then than I have now, I think. It will probably take more time. Yeah. If all that stuff like yarn shouldn't take that long. I don't see what else would be so big, other than all the yarn from my store, and all that yarn is in big bins in the basement. That's pretty much packed up. So that can just move the way it is. Yeah. And I guess the dyes
26359	always just quit her job right now. It’s not okay to quit children. It’s just not okay.
26414	That is no, because I'm you know how you don't always realize exactly what you're thinking when you're thinking it, because we're talking at the same time? Maybe if I were sitting in a room, meditating by myself, I would know what the thought was, but when I'm talking to you, it is
26631	He gives up coffee every time he has one of these things happen for a little while Which is good. and so I thought he might want to go out and have coffee with me the other day and like he could get tea or something and he wouldn't go out to the coffee shop. I don't know, you can't take that away from us. We'll have nothing left to do. Do you worry about having nothing left to do? No, we do have a lot of fun together just hanging out but it becomes a problem after a week because of his problem.
26708	you seem to sort of feel a bit more anxious, and upset, and a little pressure even when you came in, knowing that you were going to tell me about what just happened. And, I think in a way relieved that or less fear than you often are, that what you were saying was going to either, you know, hurt me or that I was going to respond in a way that was kind of using it in some way to hurt you.
26830	I can still accept myself, unconditionally. ....I can I can still accept myself despite not being a perfect human, and there is no such thing. What was that last thing you said? And there is no such thing. Good to hear you say that ! Right. It is really scary to do this kind of stuff, though.
26876	I don't like being out of I like being in control. I like feeling like I know what's going on and I can control what's going on. I felt really out of control that day, like I couldn't stop what was happening. How long had you done coke for, before that day? A year, about a year. Not every day. Mostly a couple times a week, when we would go out, because that was the year I wasn't drinking, so to me it was my substitute. Were you drinking a lot before you started doing coke?
26965	Yeah. Then I wasn't even feeling sad. I had to dye . . . You felt good enough to be productive and dye the wool. I had to dye one thing, but then I decided to dye four skeins of yarn while I was at it. That was even when I was feeling good. Things that I normally wouldn't forget. Right. That's something easily distracted. You mentioned having thoughts of selfharm. Can you describe the thoughts for me?
27058	I'm serious. I don't know. What did it look like to you? I don't know. I don't know. One of the reasons I asked is because I'm just really trying to kind of focus in and be very kind of attentive to all of this. Had you had that feeling before in your belly or stomach? It seems like have you had that feeling before? Is it usually associated with crying?
2712	So she's going to meet me and she chose a different gas station, right where she would turn onto the route. Yep. But then Jess was so sick that she needed her mom — because Jess was going out to her parents'. I see. And that's what made it easy to meet, you know. I see. She was just going to drive — Yeah. But then Jess —
27240	Those are good ideas, yeah. On a really hot day like today even walking around outside for a bit, but you can also find ways in an air conditioned building take the stairs, things like that, so that you don't feel like you're uncomfortable out in the heat but you can still find ways to walk indoors where it might be air conditioned. It sounds like you're being more aware. Keep plugging away at it. I haven't even looked at the scale in a week or two and I don't even know if I want to look at it.
27285	But that, maybe that’s a good description, because that’s also somewhat true emotionally, so... The couple of times we’ve sat largely in silence for periods of time. You... suggested during one of those that you thought it was very important to give people space, that’s just a thing that was missing from our culture more generally... So, years ago, I used to be able to like, look at a person and think while I was doing it.
27362	Yeah, it’s not constant, it’s just that it’s kind of like, well, you know, it’s comforting to　have the concept of it more than anything. And also, like, walking around a lot, blah blah blah.　I don’t know if I really could say for awhile. Yeah.
27439	keeping those thoughts in mind can speed up the process of it going away because it’s the anxious worried thoughts that keep you tight and anxious and worried. Some good distraction techniques – sometimes hopping into a warm shower if you can, you know, if you’re at home and you can do that. You can try it if you have a heating pad, you can try putting a heating pad on your chest to relax the area.
27536	and I want to make sure I’m correct that you really don’t want to go to the hospital. Part of me does, because it’s hard to have to keep the fight and not kill myself. Yeah. And part of me; most of me doesn’t, because it’s a pain in the ass, and it doesn’t seem I feel like I got to the same place that I started out in. I the option.
27581	And then you do detective work. So then what happens? What is the next step after doing what you've just done and done very well a few minutes ago in finding the "shoulds"? Is it clear to you, when you describe or observe something, that thing itself is not what is getting you in trouble? "My friends can go to the gym." Is it clear that fact or thought is not what causes the depression?
27688	Okay. That seems like it would be a good thing too. Yeah. She said, apparently, ECT will just like keep treating me, so I'm going to have to tell them to stop eventually. I don't know. Still really sad. Oh well. Glad to be back. I don't know. My psychiatrist in the hospital lives in next to me. Is it a different one than the last time?
27805	Good morning. Good morning.I am at a loss as to what to talk about again although I think in a better way this week. In general, I feel better this week than I have for the last couple of weeks. That is a good thing. The causes are not immediately obvious but I think some of it is feeling like I have been telling people that I'm upset and trying to deal with that in a, I guess, direct fashion. I don't know
28030	so that was has disappeared. It's hard to have that gone. And the day we took her to the airport we took her at like 5 in the morning and we didn't get much sleep and I figured I'd just get, you know, have a day it started really early and I was destroyed all day. I don't know if it was the exhaustion
28148	I haven't really experimented with . . . I've at least figured out that if I'm going to cut up vegetables it's better to do that at work and take a longer lunch than to have that . . . That chore in the morning. Well not just that, but if I do it before I leave, 15 minutes will make a huge difference in the commute, so I've started doing that at work. That feels a lot better for me.
28350	is, are you doing that thing at all where when somebody pisses you off, you tend to be a little more critical, you know what I mean? I’m thinking of that story, the Cambridge Business Review story? I’m not sure at all that’s what’s going on, but it did cross my mind to ask. I don’t know. It’s not that I don’t believe she could be that bad. I just ...
28430	Sometimes when you're packing up you have to erase some stuff. Yeah, so I think if I had to do that it wouldn't be a big deal. I think it's just the fact that my room isn't well organized is probably what's making it seem like such a big deal. If I can just put things into bins and contain them, then maybe it wouldn't feel so bad. So is there a project you could do on a day that you're home this week that would help you to feel more organized or more prepared? Maybe. There's a smaller bin that
28460	"Just stop going to Facebook. Stop looking at like deliberately torture yourself." Like, "Ooh, I'll start Facebook in the morning so I can feel bad all day." But he's right about that. Then I'm like, "But I have to develop those impulses." And so I can be emotionally strong and look at things objectively. And he's like, "Well, until you do that, you shouldn't." I don't know.
28684	Yeah, I think it's comforting to have the problem understood thoroughly and the long-range answer to it described in careful detail. You're not painting rosy pictures in any sense but other pictures where things are okay and they'll descriptions were how to get there in a long term scale sense, I think. How does that make me feel? So then I can sort of dwell on what it might look like to go along the path you know,
28782	Yeah. That has to do with there's some amount of trust I put in you because this is your job. But I think I've mentioned before that I don't trust that many people to do their jobs very well. Yes, and you've been under whelmed by how some people are doing their jobs. Absolutely. So that's why I said change that because it's not like just you having this job makes me trust you.
28935	have the kind of beat yourself up quality that feeling low can have? For you, it’s more like, like I get a sense that you’re indulging yourself a lot, or blaming to yourself, or feeling inadequate; sometimes you’re just feeling awful. Yeah.
29160	I don't know. It's like really unfortunate. I just feel so trapped because all I can really do is send out job applications and it's not really doing anything and I'm stuck. Well you can send out job applications which you're doing some. Yes. And you can do the dreaded networking thing. Yeah everytime I try to think it through I can't think of anyone that would be a good person to talk to and that could actually get me a job because I don't necessarily know people
29286	yeah. It brought up lots of things, you know? In a way it just shows that life is short. It's more like trying to beat the clock. This shit that I'm juggling and trying to get done, it's just . . . Work-wise it makes sense. In relationships, I think it feels more confusing what this kind of threat, loss, conflict . . . Yeah, in relationships, I don't know.
29379	That was different than what we've done before. What was that like for you? Holding my breath for four was a little bit dizzying though, it shouldn't have been. Don't judge it. It is what it is. Yeah, but like I sing. I've had to do holding, you know, using my air for a lot longer than that. It's from sitting down and stuff
29424	But then it's depressing because I know this is going to happen again. I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. That's just very depressing. It's a big country and there are a lot of people, just random, just freaks. Overall I guess I'm okay. I just feel tired. I definitely feel kind of depressed. I don't feel very motivated. I've been feeling a little bit sick to my stomach
2952	and when God talks.....and I have to show this to people... - Right. And that’s why I’ve come here to show you. And when God talks to you? Can I just clarify this with you? What? Does he talk to you like I’m talking to you, with the voice coming through your ears or does it feel more like voice doesn’t come through your ears it comes out of your mouth, voice comes out of your mouth and goes in your ears. Is that right?
29569	and that is why I don't really want to do this one, because it it feels like, "Oh, Debbie, actually did know that I was struggling to get across town, and that I wasn't going to call." It almost feels like it is the cover. Like, I'm admitting this, but that it is that I'm not perfect. And I... ...As I should be. Yes. Could you just...?
2970	this to, you know, I'm so smart, I have all these ideas. You could think of this but It wasn't about my anxiety. Maybe. I mean, clearly you are feeling anxious when you are feeling overwhelmed. Absolutely. In that sense it's your anxiety. I don't think you're actually I'm not sure that's really mostly what this is about.
29784	The stairs down to the basement at his place are really, really steep, so if I'm doing laundry at his place it's a lot easier if he carries them down; but I can carry down smaller amounts of things for myself, which I should be able to do if I have to. So I shouldn't actually be dependent on him for laundry and I'm not.
29846	Like if I had a paid internship to offer I would be like, "Here is this internship. It is paid with a stipend with X amount of money," or something. I don't think people are lacking for responses. Right? True. In this job market, the employer or the internship holder is not really at the burden of trying to get people to apply. But they might be trying to get good people to apply. I don't think it's worth your energy to debate it. Yeah.
29946	Do you remember when you were on Prozac and what dose? No....long time ago. Ok, and what about any family history, does anyone in your family have things like this? No, no it’s just me, it’s really, well they’re not really that clever you know. Who’s not that clever? My family. Your family?
30036	And you're actually being your whole self and not just editing and picking and choosing what to say and who to be. She's being her whole self, but this event, in a way, is filling you with a massive amount of terror. Again, that's something
30157	Well I have no access to what these criteria really are, so I have to sense that I have to say the right thing; I have to explain like how I would be a good fit for this position that may or may not exist based on criteria that I have no access to. So I find that nerve wrecking.
30238	don't find that anxiety does that for me. I think what he was saying is that he saw this connection to the anxiety of this character on the show and it spurred him to write that article. Anyway . . . I don't know. I feel like my depression and anxiety just makes me a worse person consistently. Certainly a more selfish person.
30317	I feel like that helps me sort of get my head around it or have some power over it. But it also seems to maybe leave out everything essential. Or Well I think you have two worries about conveying it.
30391	I'm not sure if I should tell them that will be done in December or if I will be done in September or October, which is when I could finish all the work that I was hired to do. How do you feel about this new information? I feel like I should be applying for jobs again; but then I felt depressed again yesterday and today so I haven't. I looked at one of the job sites and a lot of the things that I found weren't going to work. One that sounded really good was a temporary summer position and I don't think I could take that time off from work and then go you know.
30566	Is it that? Mm hm. On top of depression, he's depressed too but what it sounds like you're responding to are the layers of the way he regulates affect and respond interpersonally that can be manipulative, can be moving to extremes without being able to look at things in a more mature way, this is stuff in his personality that is in addition to being very depressed.
30646	I think you carry around tremendous shame about your own family, your own experiences. The problem is that you just both deal with it in opposite ways. He puts his head in the sand and you kind of do a very opposite obsessional, organizing, cleaning, organizing, cleaning, organizing, cleaning so you take it almost as a critical attack and he takes it with the withdrawal. The problem is that right now as long as you're in that place he's going to stay in this place, you know?
30719	So that's a little hard to hear. It's sort of like I was... I guess I was in the process of dealing with that issue? And then things got dramatically worse on the depression, suicidality front. And so it's hard to look back on any period of my marriage and say, that was a really good time for longer than a few weeks. Then in the actual vows portion there's the in sickness and in health part. That's kind of a... It sounds like a trap to me now. Hmm.
30802	You know, you're often the strong one for him so I wonder if now that he's doing better you know, you're often the strong one for him so I wonder if now that he's doing better you don't have to be as strong. He relies on you a lot when he's not feeling well. I guess it could be that, but the panic would have been there all along and I had just been holding it back like, you know, when you get if you're in school and you get sick right after finals because your body is like had been fighting it off like for half a semester and then all of a sudden it's like
30895	On your next inhale you're going to squeeze your knees together as tightly as you can noticing the tension in your inner thighs. When you're ready to exhale let your legs relax. Your knees may come apart. Inhale, squeeze those knees together, exhale and release letting your legs fall apart. On the next breath in you're going to straighten your legs lifting your feet up
30958	Anyway. I don’t know. I was just like, “Well, we need to make a plan, here. We’ll get you,” I don’t know, “health insurance. We’ll get you whatever. We’ll figure something out. And then, try to get you some help in terms of,” I don’t know. Because I think he—it’s not like he hadn’t tried several times to see people, but just—I don’t know.
31006	Yesterday was interesting because, you know, I felt crappy all day, you know, and it wasn't so much bummed about the game. I mean, I'm sure that affected my mood some but just, you know, felt lonely, nothing to do. Just, you know, I don't know.
31087	Considering I don't really go over to my place that often, I have enough clothes to live off of at Sydney's place, that would mean that anything that's in my room could be packed right now because if I needed it that badly, it wouldn't be in my room. So maybe thinking about sections of your room and doing a chore and getting a section done by this time, by the next time and setting that time frame of those eight or nine weeks however many weeks it is before . . .
31179	Well, I think it's inevitable because he has arthritis all over. So, he had one knee replaced and the other one needs to be replaced, but he won't do it because it was such a bad experience the first time. So, that's just going to get worse. It's not going to get better. His shoulder is really bad. Even though he's in physical therapy, it seems to not be getting better. Yeah. I mean and the pain. I just think it sucks.
3137	Part of my anxiety comes from the sense that my, in asking that question, and in feeling like you sort of pulled back at that moment as if that were like both a shocking question and perhaps too much; as if I had like in trying to fix something that I felt like I had done badly or yeah; that’s close enough. I had done another thing, I had asked too much or something.
31414	and then I just have the same things to say over and over and over again. That's all I've got. It's like this huge, giant thing for me that's blocking out everything else. Well, actually, my suspicion is that you're sort of in the middle ground there. When I first heard you say it, it was like I bet that's more than you might have shared sometime in the past, to say that you're having a bad day and give a more or less overview.
31537	And she still barely shows any concern about it and it's just a mess. So anyway I couldn't handle it all this week. That's an awful lot to try to handle in one week. You had a lot thrown at you. Yeah, they also, they gave him extra drugs to lower his heart rate even more and if it goes low enough there's like a built-in pacemaker that your heart will kick in and he kind of has it naturally because his heart rate is so low they call it the conjunctional rhythm.
31600	Yeah, I think you're right that those are interesting departure points for conversations. They are conversations that we haven't been able to have the way we would have two or three years ago in more recent days.
31697	No, I was just going to agree with you. That is interesting. After we talked about jobs and what to do, what I should be doing for the next month, she said, "Let's not wait another week and a half before we have this conversation because you just stew for days and then we talk about it. Let's just talk about it before you start stewing." That's an idea. I'm worried about trying your patience,
31876	I would say that you’ve given an example of one way you process feelings. You probably process feelings a lot of different ways. That’s not the only way you process it, but that was an elegant example of one way of processing them. So, when you say “other people,” probably the ways other people process it, you process them too.
31985	was just not with it at all. And I didn't even I remember nothing about this panel. I was in the bathroom trying to puke the entire time, and I just kept looking at myself in the mirror saying, you are going to be fine, you are going to be fine. And I was just like not with it, and then I just came down so hard from it and I had a horrible rest of the night.
32086	I was in the library all the time. It helped that the girl I had a crush on was also in the library all the time. She would sit in the library and not do her work, so I'd go to the library with her but I would get shit done. Mm-hmm. And I don't really know what changed, but
32140	There might have been…there was possibly a thought about like I should kill myself to end this feeling. And the feeling wouldn’t go away. I mean yesterday there was snow anyways, but like I’m this close to finishing my job and I’m like considering quitting right before the end when like, except that would have me leave on bad terms, but I just don’t know that I could keep it together enough. And if I keep on feeling like this, like that tightness just wasn’t going away.
32207	I don't even say that I'm angry when I'm angry because I should be better than that and it is obscure, it is so like... I don't know, it's getting really, really difficult and I don't... You sound and I think one of the things that might help is identifying what your feeling is right now. The thing that comes out most is anger like even at me today, your affect towards me is anger. You sound though underneath that Ramona, terrified.
3230	So if you're not ready to get separated one of the things I think we really need to help you do more is to learn, for right now, to not be as responsible for him. It's impossible. Cause as your language comes out Ramona, every single thing you're saying is that it's as though he's your parents and your saying "I have to take care of him and I have to be kind, then I have to coax him out of that, then I have to do this..."
32369	The one that I have seen in talking to people who have a bi-polar diagnosis, it is clear that that is a really useful thing for them to know about themselves. Absolutely; particularly a bi-polar one that looks pretty biological in the sense that, for some people, bi-polar is affected a lot by what is going on in their environment. For other people, it just isn’t and for those people it’s really good to know.
32494	How is that related to being challenging or is it separate? No, no, I mean that’s, in my mind, we have maternity leave because one needs maternity leave after childbirth in order to recover, relate to the child, take care of the child’s needs, all of that. So we have some societal accommodation there. So sort of like it’s not a secret that it’s hard, I guess, is the other…is
32527	yeah. I mean this is – I kind of feel like – I mean this is tricky; like so the thing I’m sort of trying to get my head around here, is there’s this sort of parallel where on a smaller scale, you’re sort of presenting to me how you feel unable to manage things with her.
32584	I've been I'm finally feeling better, like today and yesterday. I'm eating a little bit more now and I feel like either I'm getting used to the medication or I wasn't really having side effects at all, or maybe I'm mentally getting used to the fact that I
32647	like thinking about it and trying to do something about it the more it's on my mind all the time and basically ends up back firing. You know, so that I'm very aware that the last few weeks I haven't had much physical contact at all. Well I guess there are a couple explanations for that. One explanation is you're in touch with being angry, so you don't want physical contact.
32764	Yeah. I don’t know whether like the last time I was in Frederick I just – it feels like sharing like the externals of the situation, or versus the internal. Like when I was Frederick last time,
32907	Sunday morning was — I think because we went over Mosbie's house and I was drinking, and so I think it may have to do with dehydration a lot too. Uh huh. Like if you drink the night before, you'll do more puking. Or even if I'm just dehydrated from drinking coffee or just not drinking water, you know. Yeah. So recently I've been trying to drink more water, but I have to get up and pee more.
32968	it would make sense. If I was that person and that insane, then it would only make sense to just knock someone's door down, take a few more people out, and just blow yourself up. There are no words to explain, to feel like that could happen. I mean yeah, they were armed, but all that takes is a second. If he knows
33233	then he won't. He claims that he doesn't need to see his therapist, too. He's had a relationship with his doctor since 2005. He sees him once every three months and it's mostly just to prescribe meds. What does he take? He has ADHD, so he takes Concerta, which is one of those drugs where you kind of have to go see a physician in person every three months because of FDA regulations.
33312	"It doesn't mean you have to obsess over spending it perfectly, most wisely, whatever." Hm. "And you're keeping your sister waiting. She works like crazy all week and you don't. And this is how she's spending her weekend. You need to be more considerate." Hm. And feeling self-conscious because I felt like in that time she's taking care of me like she always has. Mm hm. She doesn't know how to stop doing that. I don't know how to - Hm.
33426	Ok, I wonder .... You’ve got to dig deep and look for it you know what I mean. Yeah, yeah. - Right. Ok. How have you been feeling physically in your physical health? Any problems there? Physically, fine, I’m, I’m fine yeah, absolutely. And have you been taking any prescribed medication besides the Prozac in the past?
33466	My ID would say I am 35, but I feel 23 and free. Free food...food for the soul, a nice bit of sole, yeah, aye...Right. A bit of fish, ah fantast, I’m not half hungry. - Right. You have any food? Any food here? You have any food, I’m starving, nah?
33568	He's got a lift ticket until noon or something like that. Is he liking it? Yeah. I think, you know, he even said he had fun even with — to him, he doesn't see it as regressing. He likes it. Good. I went to the bathroom and did my morning puking routine, which has been less and less and less. Good.
33671	I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know, like he just wanted company. He’d been alone all week. I don’t know. So, yeah. Talked to him Saturday. I don’t know. I guess on top of everything I don’t know. This woman he was dating. I don’t know. It was even a tab  on the relationship.
3373	I'm thinking that in order to express it to her I have to find the right level of not caring about the impact on her. I mean, I cannot be worried about the impact and say something. But in order not to be worried about the impact I have to, at some point, not care about what it does to her, because, if I know what's going to happen and I do it anyway, then I've done this thing. But you can't know. No, I can't know. But, if I can reasonably project that it's going to do something bad and then I do it... like, I'm not going to throw a rock at your head because I can't know what's going to happen, but it's probably going to hurt.
33773	Ok, right well it’s, I’ve got my various bits and pieces here I find in the papers like you know the football results... - Right. ...they need adding together.... - Ok. ...and then I have to find some other information on this page. There are some pages and page numbers there... - Right. - ...add those together and take it away from what’s on there. - Right. So, I do that and you find you find other things.
33866	I'm actually — it never even crossed my mind that you would have been the person, so I never even thought about that. I just thought more the large or abstract. You know, it's one of those "if I knew then what I know now." I see. But I didn't really, you know, spend too much time on that. It just popped in my head a few times. I'm wondering when I'm going to get extremely sick because, I mean, I did have that morning of diarrhea,
33989	That I’m not sure…my other set of thoughts which I’m sure are related somehow, is what you were saying earlier about thinking about in general, perhaps, my pregnancy, bringing even more to the forefront about wanting family or not wanting family, or not even knowing if it’s possible with Tanya. And clearly that’s…thinking about that.
34130	of course, I would be hurt by those things. I don't think she thought about it very much. She said she hadn't really thought about her coming close to killing herself hurting me, she was mostly just happy with herself for not having killed herself. All right, that's pretty okay; but it is also missing the effects on me and on everyone else in both of our families.
34200	He's pretty good about it. I couldn't get started. I was wanting to hurt myself and was doing really bad. I kind of sat there and thought, "Well, my therapist would probably say that this was something about feeling this way sucks; but it's familiar so it kind of comfort for me." I don't know about that. I thought, "Well . . . "
34380	It's not working right now that's very true, but what it does do is it makes you feel a little bit like, a little bit less like it will never, ever, ever, ever work. When you say it's not working that could go on you could assume in there it's not working, it's never going to work. It's not working forever.
34461	I don't particularly care if we're always going to be late if we're not also trying to get there on time. So it's sort of like a... I don't know. The utter failure to match one's own expectations is the particularly frustrating part of it for me. Anyway, so I just... the expectation that we'd be an hour late and that it was... so I can deal with that. But that's... that goes to our talking about changing expectations in the face of not being able to trust that something will happen.
34585	Or I didn't know I had another option; I really didn't. But now? I do. But now you do. Yes. So it is the "shoulds", that is what causes the depression, not all the other stuff. The "shoulds" and the lack of unconditional acceptance, and the awfulizing, and the catastrophizing contribute significantly.
34727	It’s hard to make decisions across emotional states. I always wonder whether everyone is like this, like the whole landscape changes on your having a bad day or when you’re having a good day. I imagine, if I think about it, most things are a spectrum and blah, blah, blah. I don’t know. I think that’s a little more for you, not then for everybody, but more than for most people.
34855	I don’t know whether I’m like angry about this, or just scared, or I just don’t feel good about having like, you know, I don’t feel good about having my family like know these things about me. And I don’t feel good that I wasn’t the one who got to tell them that, or got to decide whether they know that. I don’t feel good that I –
34934	We were talking at the end about what constitutes a good reason or a bad reason for making relationship decisions. I thought maybe we could take that up again. I’d be happy to do so. Thanks.
351	really I used to have that. I used to get excited when I could have the afternoon to myself, but I don't really have that any more. I try to fill my time with other things. On Wednesdays, for example, Amelia is at school until nine o'clock at night, so Wednesday is like my night to try to go see some friends or something like that, and keep myself stay at work late or do something right after work, so I'm not just like at home by myself.
3518	did do it growing up and I really did do it even college, like every summer and now I really am doing it with my spouse and so... Okay. So one of the things we have to I think get clear about in reality is his parents are not going to be parents to him in the way you want them to be.
35258	Then I get to do all my errand stuff that I need to get done. We were there last week Wednesday night, Thursday, Friday during the day, and then one day at his place. We were going to come back on Saturday night but that didn't happen and neither did Sunday, but I think what we'll do is spend Thursday night, Saturday night and Sunday night over at my place on a regular basis.
35335	when we did it before class, it made me really uncomfortable. I was really uncomfortable in class. I felt like I couldn't concentrate and couldn't sit still, and I was worried that everybody knew that I was high, and it was like, I was like I can't do that again. So it really stayed, it stayed for me, recreational. But, when you're a college kid going out two to three nights a week, you know? That's still frequent. It's frequent enough, yeah.
35398	Not really. Although the last time I seriously attended Arisia, which is the convention, I was really frustrated by, like I’m signed up to do a lot of paneling about race in science fiction, and kind of wanted to murder half the audience, and had someone, basically heckle me over a t-shirt that I have that said Black Nerds Unite. That’s terrible. Yeah, and... Yeah. Yeah, so ... Those are bad, but different.
35485	It's a small I don't know. I want to be like it's there. But I do. I mean, I was feeling I was very, very sad yesterday. I mean, sad enough to cry and not even realize that I'm out in public. But yea, today I wouldn't feel like crying. And I don't know. Maybe I just don't know how to be secure just in myself. I feel like I need a set of legitimate achievements to be able to build on my sense of being on that my sense of self. I mean, if I did nothing at all.
35592	what they're supposed to take or how much, but you're very careful about that. It's good to have the release so we can communicate if needed, but with you doing good follow up with her it's not as necessary for me to hear her say the exact same thing. Okay, that makes sense. I guess I should call her this afternoon
35705	Everything I do might have an affect but I just don't know which one is going to have an effect. And you're also giving yourself days off where you're not - I am because - Okay. it's like after spending hours on the computer - it's like I just can't be on the computer any more. Yeah. Do you think it would help you, Ramona, to have something part time that you were doing? And I mean that specifically around, forget even money, let's say you had money. Would it help you to - I have.
35799	Do you feel trapped in any way? Absolutely, yeah. No, but I think we've talked about that some before. I've felt trapped in a lot of ways. And one of the things that I do when I feel trapped is I try to find a way to like get out of it. And so one of the ways that I have gotten out of it is by finishing my dissertation. So I feel less trapped in a... My advisor's still paying me, and I'm still doing like some revisions and writing up papers, but I'm not trapped in that relationship that's in this weird place where I'm half-way across the country, we meet by video conference when
35881	Yeah definitely, yeah definitely, all of those actually. Ok. What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens, the first adrenaline release occurs out of the blue, and perhaps at times of stress,
36004	I was just kind of like, “I want to tell you, film exists, and it has for awhile”. And it’s interesting that they, students try to turn them into videos, except they didn’t do it very well, so that was kind of weird. And then she had a whole about updating Wikipedia, because Wikipedia doesn’t have a lot of information about Africa, African culture, African diaspora type stuff.
36070	And I like, I would have skipped, like, I would have rather skipped going over there for dinner. Even though I did end up having a great opportunity to hang out with my friend Wanda for a couple of hours, and blah blah blah. Really annoying. Yeah, the hoarder house part just always makes me like, “agggh!” Well, you had just been overcrowded all weekend, I think.
36127	Except that then if I'm at his place I'll feel uncomfortable eating in the kitchen by myself because I don't live there and that feels weird, too. People are around. That doesn't really work. I guess I'd have to decide which is worse, eating in the kitchen when there are people around when I don't live there or Sydney isn't there and it feels like it's less valid for me to just be there by myself. Or spending more time in your place. Or spending more time in my place. You're not spending time in your place because it's less comfortable. There's never anything to eat at my place.
36169	There’s a sense in which all of it is okay. It’s hard to deal with it and it makes me less efficient, the work that I’m doing. I’m like I just need to get through it and it will be done. It’s okay. Did you finish the paper? I can get things done. I will get the application done. Probably today or tomorrow I’ll be sending them out.
36325	And we were able together to put things in perspective. You were able to laugh, you were able to make a practical plan and at least clarify that the practical plan you considered already was efficient, reminding yourself that tomorrow, Tuesday you are going to a doctor, a REAL doctor, so you're going to speak to someone who has a medical degree... And we'll see what happens from there. Okay.
36511	I think so. More just severe anxiety, which I don't get that often. I know this is kind of an odd type question, but what do you think is in there? Feelings. They're stuffed away. It's disconcerting to me that I could, you know, maybe I'm saying that it wasn't gradual then. That I just kind of, I just turn it off. Well, gradual or not, you know this about yourself.
36637	Yes, I don’t know how to make that decision with what you think you know. So half this why would anyone want this, you know, that all hinges on the meaning of want or the variety of different maybe hinges on this; I don’t know. Yes, so in other contexts I have something like three responses to uncertainty. One is to formulate
36702	...In identifying the Bs you came up with that and the Ds and the Es, which, for a few weeks, you have said you're really not comfortable with. Mm-hmm. Make sense? Yeah. Will you do that? It makes imperfect sense. No, I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha. All right. Any final comments, thoughts, or questions before we finish for tonight?
36743	Yeah, that's true. And I think having a little bit of structure, having a place to be, even if it's... Volunteering is a wonderful thing to do. Yeah. Just don't want to volunteer forever... No. ...because that would drive me insane. No. You don't want to only volunteer forever. Like I could volunteer on top of a job depending on what that job is. But...
36786	When my parents divorced I wanted to die and later when they both remarried. I have talked to my counselor about that too - the suicide stuff. Do you or have you ever had a suicide plan? I used to when I was a teenager. I would take a bunch of pills or just get into my mom’s car and turn it on and go to sleep in the closed-up garage. That was when I was in junior high and high school.
36897	Probably, yeah. The doctor said it's one of the biggest hearts he's seen. He said he probably has a genetically large heart. He's an athlete which makes your heart really thick, so there was extra stuff to stretch out or something. All kinds of unlucky things. So, and then they put him on he got really badly, not really badly burned, but they gave him a lot of electricity this time and he got a really bad burn and it kept him up a couple of nights like he couldn't sleep because he has a giant burn on his back.
36992	Hi, I’m one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine and you are? Taylor. I have spoken with your physician, Dr. White, and have read his reports and know some of the things about why you are here today. However, I would like to hear from you why you have come to see me today. I am having trouble sleeping.
37073	If there are not going to be parents who are going to help on either side. Will your parents? My mom is apparently still not talking to me from two weeks ago when I asked about Easter so I'm not...sometimes she can be really helpful and other times her own, like she's really not. Not a good situation and my dad doesn't do any type of emotional discussion.
37143	Actually I know a lot of people who call at the last minute, get their schedule and function just fine. After a month of not having a job? Yes. I'm not saying that's ideal I'm totally with you on the way you're doing it is more appropriate but this is the kind of thing you...we need to help you, even for one month, not do. Your taking on being his mother.
37295	But, yeah. He's got a lot of energy, you know? If he's just sitting around the house, he just bounces. He doesn't do it when he comes over to my place. He just kind of sits, hangs out and watches TV. He's pretty mellow. We go out to dinner and he's mellow. But when he's home with Jess, he pushes her a lot more than he pushes me. In fact, he really doesn't push me at all. In what ways does he push her?
37404	Yeah, and I guess that's why I'm so happy that he's, I mean he let this girl in to see what was going on and I don't know what it is about my family that he feels so comforted by And he really does feel comfortable with them. Yeah, it's really nice. So, maybe he's turned a corner, I don't know. He's finding a new way to kind of fit in. Yeah, if he could get a friend If I could get a friend. Another one.
37531	Well clearly you have a lot of fears and fantasies about what this means. I’m sorry; what is the antecedent?
37724	Which is, itself, interesting. I think the fact that you guys are married makes it a little bit less convincing statement, but when people in their 20s get sick they often go home and get treatment where their parents are. It's a logistical dimension that also has a meaning in itself. That's not at all uncommon. You're working on that. Yeah. I agree that, particularly in college, when people get sick they go home fairly often.
37769	He was like, "You don't have to go through the travel agency. Why don't you just book a ticket on the Internet from Boston to L.A." I was like, "Okay. What time does our flight from L.A. depart?" "I don't know. Why do you want to know that?" We should stop. Sorry. I got going. No, no. It's okay. Go ahead. I hate my parents. That's all. This is another can of worms, but I have three things quickly
37870	even like actually do anything to temporarily relieve the pain, it just, my brain thinks it will and but like he isn't even okay with that, so it's not like I'm going to change his mind on anything. Would it be okay with you? Do you think it's okay to hurt yourself? Maybe if it wasn't permanently damaging or even like damaging at all, like just momentarily cause pain like I don't see the big problem with it. You know if it wasn't something that could become dangerous like I'm really liking the things that could do it, but like -
37924	maybe angry at your dad for not taking someone's advice for feeling angry at life for being so unjust.
38040	He also does psychoanalysis/therapy sort of stuff. He's not just a prescriber; but Dave refuses to go in for therapy to talk about some of this stuff. He won't tell me how he's feeling until he blows up at me and accuses me of not loving him. It's really frustrating. Yep.  You're utterly overwhelmed. Yeah. And at your wits end. Yep. And how suicidal?
38111	And if they don't work, I'm just going to sell the rest of the bottle. I probably could do better than the Klonopin. So it's kind of a win all the way around? Yeah, you know. It's like I just have to wait until Phish comes back to town and walk through the parking lot. Those people would want to go in the other direction. No, because once the show is over — Oh.
38179	or kind of nearly empty reassurances from people who are sort of anxious and have a sense of your need and don't know what to do. Hmm. That then confirms your impression that they clearly have no idea what's going on or what to do. Have no idea. I can't say you're wrong. And certainly a lot about the mental health establishment plays right into that too, completely apart from you. Hm. Yeah.
38217	like for me the biggest frustration, and I was talking to Dr. Bond about it, and she was like “Well”, so I went up to I guess the clinical I guess, the amount she wanted me to take of Celexa a week ago. So she’s like, “Well, you know maybe it’s more time” which, I agree with theoretically. I’m just really not enjoying it. Yeah.
38288	And then like I'll move past it. But it's a very, I don't know why, but those the three words that come into my mind when something like that happens. Mm. And that's become a coping thing for me. Mm hm. And I know that's unhealthy and I want to work on that. Okay. So you can think of an example specifically. You named a couple saying, "It could be this, it could be that." Is there something you remember at all happening since I saw you last?
38403	When you say that, what's happening? Is he not getting to work? Like he didn't have a schedule for this week. He didn't and I like "Okay, you need to call this morning and you need to get that." So that's what you need to not do anymore. I can't. Well that's your responsibility though, that's not his responsibility, that's more a symptom.
38459	I feel really stupid. Like maybe I shouldn't have gone into like library science and archives. Maybe I should have completely changed my focus to something more practical that like actually has jobs. But the things that do have jobs are like, you know... I don't even know. Anything... At this point any further education is only going to make me overqualified for things in my field and like I can't like start another bachelor's degree to like get a degree in computer science or something
38531	I could take a nap right now. Sorry I’m just like – I don’t even want to say like, “Okay Chad.” So I’ll tackle the afternoon. I’m sorry. You know, I’m imagining that you’re feeling a bunch of pressure from me to make a plan not to kill yourself and to stay alive. And that feels pretty awful.
38592	like around 11:00. And then I got home and I was talking to my friend in Phoenix, so we were talking. I had the window kind of open and I saw all of these cops flying down the street and I thought, "That's weird." The cops were going really fast. I was like, "Yeah, this is not normal." Then by the time I told Giorgio, I heard two loud noise and then I hung up. You went down to get your mom?
38732	The depression. I think I picked up the depression. No, it was the marriage counselor that took me through the checklist. Oh no, I was pretty sure you were depressed. I think I probably had you diagnosed that way for — You didn't bring it up. Oh, okay, that's very possible.
38819	I think I can do that. That sounds manageable? It just doesn’t sound like it’s going to be enough. It’s not enough forever. But it’s what you can fit in these couple of days so that instead of seeing all the options that are closed to you, it’s the option that you can take these couple of days. I want to go on walks. I really do. Just drudging through the snow with my snow boots and things being slippery, I hate it so much. I know.
38936	is that it can't go a lot faster even if Ivan were to go into the hospital for example, say he were to feel so suicidal again that Dr. Bourd...to me what feels hopeful about this is whether you and Ivan stay together or not, is Ivan is now,
38964	But that's not the case. And what if the reality is this type of job is, you know, totally unrelated to what he went to school for. What if that's the best fit for him for now, for a while? Mm hm. It's scary for me and I feel bad about that. Hm. I feel responsible that he doesn't feel proud of it. Mm. That he's like afraid to feel proud of it. Mm hm. If he were a doctor right now - Yeah.
39037	and still okay, and still even good. Yeah, I think in a general sense, it seems helpful to... have the non-ideality be acknowledged. But there are unhelpful ways of doing that. People will say things like, “Well, nothing is perfect.” That’s true, but that’s... you know, that’s the... if my... view of things is non ideal, and therefore bad, it’s naïve
39113	Maybe more generally like, this concern like, “Do the people in charge know what they’re doing?” Yeah. And... In many circumstances, the answer is “sort of.”
39217	I really got the winner's share of the farm. All the male players on my team are going out Saturday night and Sunday I have the football game. What are you going to do with all your free time?
39279	Yeah, yeah. You can go back to Dr. Carlton, but I don't think this is something that we should medicate. This is what you would do if something like this happened. It was starting to happen after Monday and you will come out of this, probably actually sooner than you think. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. I've been reminding myself of that, too. That's what I was saying, I'm actually handling it better than . . .
39359	If you continue to feel like Dr. Farrow's not getting it, like if you feel like it's biased and you've had a chance to talk about that then it's not working for you.
39480	I loved my grandparents as a child. I love this house, except for the basement. I used to have to play with my cousin in the basement. He was not a nice person, five years older than me and liked to teach me all sorts of things - sexual things. I was only five at the time and didn’t understand. I felt dirty and ashamed. I didn’t tell anyone until I was an adult. I have gone to counselling for this as an adult - no one else knows.
39571	They're just so I don't even know what they're talking about. They're arguing over stuff and taking hot shots at each other. The disenfranchised trustee is, you know, both trustees gave me
39649	Like, “You know, today it’s one thing, and tomorrow it might be something else. I’m going to revise and update.” Whereas like, “This is how it works.” I know that’s not – It’s close anyway. I don’t know, but I think – I think actually what I’m sort of objecting to, I’m not getting mad at I don’t know.
39744	I'm not sure because they're like at least a couple but then again maybe you could consider them like you know if I don't get a distraction then it's one panic attack, just a very long panic attack, you know, and then I guess like when I have rehearsal and stuff, okay so I have a panic right before rehearsal, go to rehearsal, feel fine for rehearsal, get out of rehearsal another panic attack. So whenever you're not occupied. Yeah. Your mind or your body are panicking.
39833	Dr. Barnes, when I had asked her before, she doesn't really think I could go up more on the Desipramine and that. She didn't think going up more would actually help. It's really hard when I'm feeling this miserable to want to go out and exercise and do stuff.
39927	the name of it, but it was near Southwest—it was basically people are finishing up their Ph.D. who needed hours. And I think it’s you pay on a sliding scale. So, I told him to look into that. You pick whatever you can kind of thing. I don’t know. I thought that would be good, because I feel like—I don’t know. I don’t know. These people would be super-eager to help him. And they’re being advised or
40041	express my pain and frustration. Well I think there's... You know, the... Part of it is the chronicity of it in that this is not, these are not isolated events. They're not feeling like isolated events anymore. Yeah.
40102	It’s sort of it occurs to me that I should probably talk out some of the features of the last week. So Tanya’s friend Candace came to visit. Candace was Tanya’s roommate at William & Mary. A very good friend; she’s great. So one of the few people for who it’s always good for for who for Tanya it’s always good to visit so, it’s helpful to have her be here. It’s good.
40189	Yeah. And like he's been depressed for almost a year. Like that's a really long time. Yes it is. I mean, it's not his fault because like he's at least, it's not like he's been avoiding therapy and drugs or anything like that. He's... He has appointments. He makes them. He goes to them. I mean, granted a lot of his therapy has been phone sessions because he's been feeling sick but he still usually goes to his therapy twice a week. But it's...
40255	I don't know exactly why. I have been feeling more angry at it. I think there's a sense in which Tanya wants to have her life back and have it be okay and wants to . . . yeah, I'm not exactly sure.
40370	we're... some of us are leaving the reception, the wedding reception at 2:00 in the morning. There's still a whole lot of dancing and drinking and partying going on. But it's time for some of us to leave, myself included. But Amanda, Tanya's sister, is still there. And so, in that... that was the only moment in which we had anything like a conversation about it. And in that moment she wanted to tell me that... I wanted to leave, didn't really want to be having a conversation at that moment. This was a, like,
40464	that stuff than there generally is. Yeah, and the hotel that it’s in, while there’s a lot of space, which is good, the main lobby area is like, it was designed for business conventions, not a ton of people being really social and running around screaming. So, you know, like ... there’s that setup,
40562	I don't know completely why. I always do. Huh. I think it's really it is the money. I have some issues with money - Huh. being spent on me. Hm. So one of the things I wonder, because you're describing it both in money and then also in time, your sister's time. If it is hard for you to be given to, like really for someone to lovingly give something to you that you take - Yeah.
40657	about trust. I mean we did because that was where the conversation went. And I didn’t avoid it like I do sometimes. But that ends up in the place where I say like I don’t trust here and why should I so which I feel like is not particularly helpful to Tanya when she’s, you know, struggling with her broken leg. Well but it’s the truth. Yes.
40725	It’s also a feature of like, dinner with more than one person, so I... And I do wonder like, what other people are thinking about in other contexts, also, but... Sometimes I have a clear sense of what they’re doing, and I do hear. So like, in a lot of meetings, I know which of my colleagues
40783	I just sort of was “Oh my God. I hate everyone”. I mean, and also I had a complete　freak out before packing because I couldn’t find a bottle of painkillers. I had a bottle of Vicodin　and I couldn’t find it anywhere. So I got super stressed about it, like tearing apart my　apartment. Sorry. What’s hurting? My hip. That did used to hurt. I know I haven’t heard for awhile, I don’t think we’ve　talked about it for awhile.
4086	And so I asked my roommate to see if they would be a good fit. And they're not. And I was like I was a little upset by that because Elaina's like, "Yea, the girl is a little pushy." And I'm thinking she can't be any pushier than me. Or when do you guys actually see each other? Not that often. It was kind of lonely in that place because I wouldn't see my roommates for days. And there's such little interaction time. Why does it matter that the person you don't really see that often is pushy? I don't know.
40902	Yeah. So rather than look for reasons why it might not be good now or might not be good in the future, I wonder what stops you from letting yourself kind of give it a try. I guess it’s the depression is what stops me. The anxiety. Your job is for you to be in control and not let the anxiety and depression be in control. Anxiety and depression impact you, but you don’t have to let it control you. So I know that it…
40967	Yes - when soldiers come home and have a hard time adapting back into normal life, right? That is correct. There are other situations where people can have PTSD such as traumatic stressful events such as car accidents, living through a natural disaster,
41028	Right now volunteering wouldn't really getting in the way of something else. You have time to do it. It's just annoying that I don't have something else to do. Because now it's been over a year that I have been unemployed. And like I really didn't think I'd be unemployed this long. It's longer than you expected. Yeah. Like I really thought I'd find a job. It's a long time. And I haven't and like the, I don't know, the economy is getting better but
41165	Does that make it’s not a great analogy. It actually is a pretty good analogy but that’s sort of how I don’t know if that addresses some of the frustration that you’re feeling.
41293	The idea of your saying things that interest me is maybe a way I would want you to stay around. Hm. Seems reasonable. Yeah, that one's complicated. I assume you don't have anyone that comes in here and tries to alienate you. Like that they're so above they're going to throw on, I don't know...
41376	In other words, what I mean is depression is not very descriptive compared to something like paranoid schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder. Those things seem more descriptive than things like depression or generalized anxiety. I think that depression is about as useful a description as fever, in some ways. Yes, whereas I do think that something like paranoid schizophrenia or disorder are a little more useful, I think. It doesn’t say a lot about who the person is.
41441	To remind myself that I am a fallible human that does make mistakes, that doesn't do everything exactly like an ingredient that you put together and come up with some perfect model person; and that I'll still be loved, and if I'm not loved, then that is I have to love myself so that...
41529	No, I don't think so. No. I am encouraging you to dispute. I'm energetic. Yeah. But am I telling you, "Do it perfectly well, Jessa?" No. No, so you're adding that. Are you not? I am. So that is my hypothesis, that you're finding it is hard because you add to the task that you should be able to do it better, you should do it right. Yes.
41674	Well, notice that. You told me that you believed in your drama queen friend who is not a doctor, who was telling you you're going to be paralyzed for the rest of your life. Yes. It is the same tendency to assume and not question, assume and not question. OK. So time is moving on and we're not going to have time now...
41792	So I'm going to a conference next week and making a poster. I finished the poster last night.
41836	what do you think would be helpful for you to work on this week? I think what actually would be helpful, instead of focusing on the "should," the "musts," and writing that down, I think taking it how you did, with the next step, like going that next level. Because I think that is important for me to really get the concept that it is not just, "I should be."
4203	And not a lot of space in there, in either case, for someone actually taking care of you really. Really loving and being there for you. Maybe in your sister. That's as close as you got. Yeah. Completely in Emma. Yeah. But, again, she does something that she is very passionate about, and works incredibly hard, and has been ambitious, and getting more degrees, and going above and beyond her forty hours a week. Well beyond that. Mm hm.
42128	Oh well isn't that interesting notice your self-evaluation. Telling your father what you think and feel makes you a bitch? That's my go to...my go to, I have to, I end up allowing myself to feel guilty when he's being caring and telling me what he thinks I should do and I don't go with it.
42252	Not really, you know. Micah was kind of explaining to me how it's difficult sometimes, like it's kind of — you know, that's why even her talking to me, I think for her it was more of just "hey, let's try" more than really — she just saw the low motivation. Right. She fixes things with drugs, that's what she does. I mean, you've got a history of not picking things up. What else did I not pick up?
42341	Right! I'm really worried about the threats and the note and I'm very worried about it obviously but I'm also again, it sounds horribly selfish but I've taken a moment and am realizing this is really tough to deal with. I'm not doing it completely alone obviously but it feels like that sometimes when I'm not here. Yeah.
42426	So it's doing what you can to manage the anxieties that you have control over, and it sounds like with the dinner situation it's really about seeing if you can separate a little bit the control that the depression has on Sydney versus the control that his depression has on you and allowing yourself some independence from his depression. It also doesn't say that I couldn't go out by myself, other than now I'm spending all the money.
42567	but I know how to manage information and I know how to do these logistical things so I go to those things because they're solvable or closer to solvable. What do I do that my wife want to kill herself? You handle the practical problems and they are the practical problems of who needs to know what and what do I need to do to make it from one day to the next.
4266	I would either when I was younger, I would usually just buy an extra snack from the cafeteria at school, or I would tell my mom I was taking lunch money, but I would take more so I could get some extra snacks. So you really thought about this, this was planned. Oh, yeah, yeah. Then, once I could drive, in high school, that's the end of it.
42769	A little anxiety. Yeah. I don't seem to have that many kind of much annoying side effects. That's great. Yeah. So everything's been okay? Yeah, I personally think that's been okay. If I'm losing things; I'm losing them completely enough that I don't know that it's gone, which is good enough. I've had one person a number of years ago who had had a
42846	Your goal is to get a job and you can spend a lot of energy trying to make an assessment or assumption about what the employer wants or has to offer... Yeah. But you don't really know unless you ask. And is it okay to send that sort of e-mail to something? If... Sure. "I'm interested in this position. I noticed that there was no compensation mentioned. Is compensation available for this position?" Uh huh.
42957	is that, in that memory are you, is it sort of an anger refusal or is just like I'm not interested? No, it's kind of an aversion. An aversion. Like, almost a disgust? A what? A disgust response.
43040	Yes. Yes. That kind of, I kind of just accepted it. I haven't really dealt with it, I think. I think Harold expressed more. He was more in touch with being angry about that than I was. I don't know. I think at the time I was more concerned about what my mother was going to do. So, when it was all happening and then afterwards it just was. Now I think you're right. Now when I want to retire, I can't. So, it is an issue. On that practical level, which has deep emotional implications and feeling
43105	it sounded accusatory to me and he called me back after a while cause he couldn't wait to hear if I had gotten hold of Dr. Bourd and he's telling me that Ivan has had some struggles with this before, he's like "Ivan doesn't know it but he wrote a poem in seventh grade and his teacher called me because it was dark..." and I wanted to say "Why didn't you do anything, why didn't you...?" But all I said was "I feel like clearly in grad school, even a little before, Ivan needed some help with this and he didn't get it."
43174	vindictive, or deliberately intended as a punishment, but you know, she just really couldn’t cope with like doing another load of laundry. But still, like – Yeah, if Madison were my kid, I wouldn’t want Yvonne to have – even have full custody. And of course I can’t say that to her, because I’m supposed to be on her side with the divorce, and just Right. I’m sorry; this has turned into like third party diagnosing of Yvonne’s problems instead of talking about me. I
43252	Nothing specific. I was all over the place. To where? I don't know. I was thinking on the one hand, what sucks now is I'm full of anxiety, but what is the next thing that's going to happen? Like what's the next bad thing that's going to happen? Today I was like, "I could try to write about this," but then, of course, I was thinking, "Yeah, well that's what I say about a lot of things and then I don't actually do anything."
43353	but that usually goes hand-in-hand with the other ones. So like here’s a range of possible mechanisms for a chemical reaction. We can rule out all but two of them. We can’t decide between them but leave at least ruled out all of the other ones. You did that some time ago, right? You presented the manifold of worlds in which I would be okay and hence, essentially two features on it. So,
43483	You've got to wash the pot out, empty the thing, put the filter in, and put the coffee in. I don't know why. These little things in life just get in my way. The hiccups. I wonder if Lucille is going to go with her grandmother when she picks her up today. You mean she might get cranky?
43609	Yeah. You know, things like taking care of him and making food and doing all these things that like, you know, when I was sick and he was panicking, I would still do things for him. You know? I would still make him food even when I was sick or like do crazy things like emptying the dishwasher at his place, standing on a chair while dizzy which I really should not have been doing and things like that. But when he's sick and I'm panicking because he's sick,
43669	And was the hope that had I had a miscarriage or had an abortion or something like this – I guess those were the two conditions under which I would be pregnant and not have a child right, I guess those were the only two – that I would say more about that or just that it would be acknowledged or what would happen? That’s a good question.
4808	We should stop for now.
